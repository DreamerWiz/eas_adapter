# EAS Practice

This is a repo to implement basic interactions wtih EAS protocol.

##  Framework

- EAS: https://easscan.org/
- Foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/
- *Ganache: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
- *Blockscout: https://www.blockscout.com/

## Introduction

The project uses foundry commands to publish(in ganache) and verify(in blockscout) contracts to interact with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), which is a public good that enables anyone to make attestations on or off-chain about anything.

Contracts are copied to private chain to do development and test. Need to set correct contract addresses and rpc provider to test the project in other chains.
